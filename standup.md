# Standup Notes
### Date: 10.12.2022;  Location: Zoom meeting;  Attendees: Killua, Kyoya, Senku
## What did I work on yesterday?
- Killua: Built the graph using adjacency list
- Kyoya: Reviewed the algorithm for BFS and DFS
- Senku: Reviewed the algorithm for finding the shortest path between 2 vtxs
## What am I working on today?
- Killua: Trying to figure out a data structure that can significantly reduce the time complexity
- Kyoya: Listing the pros and cons of these two algorithms
- Senku: Writing the Dijkstra's algorithm
## What issues are blocking me?
- Killua: Time complexity is huge
- Kyoya: No issues
- Senku: Still the time complexity issue
